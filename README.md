# job-app-quiz

The site *REDACTED*.com/quiz has a list of numbers.

Hidden in the HTML is a Javascript function to encode a string
into a list of numbers using 3 offsets

These numbers presumably contain a message with instructions to send a CV
These instructions are presumably in English, using latin letters

This code will retrieve the HTML, parse it, use a partly-brute force and partly-intelligent algorithm to determine the likely encoding seeds, and reverse the encoding
